# JobSort

[JobSort](https://jobsort.com) is a fast job search engine built by developers for developers. JobSort crawls the Internet for new jobs every day to create its jobs database. Some folks like its speed and custom filtering language called JobSort Query Language (JSQL).

Thanks to those who have given words of advice over the past months to guide future development. If you're curious, the name "JobSort" derives from the well-known sorting algorithm "QuickSort."

## Features

*   The database has more than 20 000 jobs that are constantly refreshed.
*   The flexible **JobSort Query Language (JSQL)** enables deep searching inside the big database. It'll almost feel like coding when you're searching.
*   **"Job health-checks"** test if each job is still available as you scroll through the results. If the job is dead, it gets stricken through so you don't land on a 404 page.
